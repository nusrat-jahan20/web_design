        <li>Apple : An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are
        the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus
        sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to
        North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including
        Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.</li>

        <li>Orange : The orange is the fruit of various citrus species in the family Rutaceae (see list of plants known as orange); it
        primarily refers to Citrus × sinensis, which is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related Citrus ×
        aurantium, referred to as bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis through nucellar embryony);
        varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations.</li>

        <li>Strawbery : The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa) is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. The fruit is widely
        appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large
        quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates.
        Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume,
        and many others.</li>
